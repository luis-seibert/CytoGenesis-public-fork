# Base functions

## IMPORTANT/MAJOR:
- add loosing condition during run?
    - production/research aim, failure -> loosing "health" / game
    - increasing input costs (inoculum) -> loose if points not enough for next round
    - economic pressure, market fluctuations?

- scale game speed with number of cell growth cycles until all hex are full
- add evolution system, mutation rate probability to produce mutations that can be used to buy cellular perks
- change lab upgrade details, make more natural and intuitive
    - maybe begin with 1 ring -> petri dish, upgrade to bioreactor with capacity upgrades?

- display cultivation parameters (plot cultivation data during col phase)
    - add more complex simulation, growth rate, oxygen etc.
- increasing difficulty with rounds:
- environmental changes: temperature, pH, contaminations, nutrient, ...
- increasing maintenance costs make game more difficult
## LESS IMPORTANT:
- fps counter not working correctly in slow fps -> still shows high?

## FAR FUTURE:
- emergency buttons for temporary bonus?

- make late game (after 10 or so rounds), add production of protein of interest, that gives different type of points that can be used for advanced upgrades
- Add tech tree for lab devices, cell line
- add meta progression: ?
- add compendium to main menu, "Basics of bioprocess engineering" - that explain most important mechanics

## Ideas for shop
### PERKS:
- start tile energy -> could be increased by perk
- increase inoculum, temp and permanent as a perk
- mixing speed -> randomness of nutrient decreases
- nutrient consumption rate
- nutrient affinity?
- mutation rate?
- certificates (quality), contracts -> increase biomass gain

- add refresh of shop
- adjust optics and layout of shop, could be same as lab space, with basic devices to buy and upgrade, adjust col_phase accordingly

### FAR FUTURE:
- different strains with unique appearance and traits
- perks have different qualities (common, rare, etc.)
- perks have "set bonuses", and or synergies

## Improve user experience
- implement nice background/overlay for microscope/over

### FAR FUTURE:
- implement background music
- fine-tune text positions
- prices and item values need to be fine tuned
- game stage durations need to be fine tuned to make fun
- add sounds

## Current Roadmap:
- Implement plotting of process parameters
- make reroll for shop items
