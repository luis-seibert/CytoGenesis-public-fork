# TODO:  Base functions

# IMPORTANT:
# add loosing condition: ?
# production/research aim, failure -< loosing "health" / game
# increasing input costs (inoculum) -> loose if points not enough for next round
# economic pressure, market fluctuations?

# End of game, enter -> return to main menu
# switch fonts to pixel font
# unite global variables into one data object (perks)
# adjust speed of scaling level speed with number of cell growth cycles until all hex are full
# make more reactor images, scale fps with mixing perk, which is connected to randomness of nutrient
# add evolution system, mutation rate probability to produce mutations that can be used to buy cellular perks
# biomass/product can be used to buy and upgrade lab devices, nutrient broth etc.

# LESS IMPORTANT:
# fps counter not working correctly in slow fps -> still shows high

# OPTIONAL:
# Fix FPS font flickering
# maybe begin with 1 ring -> petri dish, upgrade to bioractor with capacity upgrades

# FAR FUTURE:
# display cultivation parameters (plot cultivation data during col phase)
# emergency buttons for temp bonus?

# increasing difficulty with rounds:
# environmental changes: temperature, pH, contaminations, nutrient, ...
# increasing maintenance costs

# make lategame (after 10 or so rounds), add production of protein of interest, that gives different type of points that can be used for advanced upgrades
# Add tech tree for lab devices, cell line
# add meta progression: ?
# add compendium to main menu, "Basics of bioprocess engineering" - that explain most important mechanics

# TODO: Ideas for shop
# PERKS:
# start tile energy -> could be increased by perk
# increase inoculum, temp and permanent as a perk
# mixing speed -> randomness of nutrient decreases
# nutrient consumption rate
# nutrient affinity?
# mutation rate?
# certificates (quality), contracts -> increase biomass gain

# add refresh of shop
# adjust optics and layout of shop, could be same as lab space, with basic devices to buy and upgrade, adjust col_phase accordingly

# FAR FUTURE:
# different strains with unique appearance and traits
# perks have different qualities (common, rare, etc.)
# perks have "set boni", synergies

# TODO: Improve user experience
# implement nice background/overlay for microscope/over

# FAR FUTURE:
# implement background music
# fine-tune text positions
