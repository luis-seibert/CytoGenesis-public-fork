# CytoGenesis - A Bioprocess Engineering Game

CytoGenesis is a (potentially educational) game focused on cellular biology and bioprocess engineering. 

Players manage cell colonies on hexagonal grids, optimizing growth conditions and navigating through different phases of cellular development, aiming at maximizing biomass yields. Difficulty is introduced by steadily increasing reactor mixing inhomogeneities, that make it more difficult to colonize the substrate efficiently.

The core simulation of growth dynamics and nutrient uptake is based on Monod-kinetics, an established mathematical model to describe microbial growth.
